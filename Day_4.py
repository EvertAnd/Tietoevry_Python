# 1. FizzBuzz
# Print a string 1,2,3,4, Fizz, 6, Buzz, 8, ..... 34, FizzBuzz, 36, .... to 97, Buzz, 99, Fizz
# So if number divided by 5 then Fizz If divided by 7 then Buzz, If divided by 5 AND 7 then FizzBuzz otherwise the same number
#  Note: such a task became popular as the first task to ask to determine whether a person knows about programming at all smile

Fizz = 5
Buzz = 7

# for n in range(start, the_end):
#     print(n,end="")

#  2. Christmas tree
# Enter the height of the tree
# Print the tree: Ex. height == 3
# The printout would be:
#   *
#  ***
# *****
# Note: remember that several symbols can be printed at once, for example: print ("" * 10 + "*" * 6)

# height = int(input("Cik garu eglÄ«ti gribi?: "))
# for i in range(height):
#     print(' ' * (height - i - 1) + '*' * (2 * i + 1))  # x2 is always rounded up
